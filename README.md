# JavaScript-Dice-Game
The game logic is built under Javascript and it was built during my learning journey of Javascript. This game mainly focuses on <strong>DOM manipulation</strong>, as well as 
<strong>toggling CSS classes</strong>. I provided a brief instruction below that shows how the game works.

Instructions:
This is a turn-based two player game, where each turn the current player rolls a dice and its score increments based on the corresponding rolled number. As such, the player
has to hold its current score and add it to its total score, once held it will switch to another player's turn. If the player rolls a '1', the score will not be added 
and it will switch to another player's turn as well. The game keeps progressing until one player scores 100 or more.
